| K40 [coin] | 1.3926426e8 | MaGe: `GERDAPhaseII-Dec2017/9fe03ca` (gerda-sw-all: `g4.10.3_v2.1`) | The number of primaries is calculated such that if you put together *all* the four parts in the cables volume (i.e. hv_cables, hv_at_holder, sig_cables and sig_at_holders) you get 1E09 primaries uniformly distributed all over the complete volume | B.Schneider |
| K40 [edep] | 1.3926426e7 | MaGe: `GERDAPhaseII-Dec2017/9fe03ca` (gerda-sw-all: `g4.10.3_v2.0`) | The number of primaries is calculated such that if you put together *all* the four parts in the cables volume (i.e. hv_cables, hv_at_holder, sig_cables and sig_at_holders) you get 1E08 primaries uniformly distributed all over the complete volume. You can find also simulations with Decay0 under `dk0/` | L.Pertoldi |
