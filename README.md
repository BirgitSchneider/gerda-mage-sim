# gerda-simulations

The aim of this repository is to provide a mirror (without actual data files) of the `/nfs/gerda5/var/gerda-simulations/gerda-mc2' folder at LNGS cluster. It can be easily browsed to check the current status of the simulations (what has been simulated and what has not) and inspect the MaGe macro files.

Refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mppmu/gerda-snippets/wiki/MaGe-simulations-stored-at-LNGS) for further documentation. [Here](https://github.com/mppmu/gerda-snippets/tree/master/MaGe-macros) you find a reference macro file for MaGe.
