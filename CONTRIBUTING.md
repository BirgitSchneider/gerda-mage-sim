# Contributing

The recommended way to contribute to the `gerda-mage-sim` project is to provide only the `.mac` files to the maintainers to be further processed at MPIK, a copy of the `.root` files between clusters is usually painful.

* clone the `gerda-mage-sim` repository locally (with `--recursive` if you want to use the software!)
* make your changes/additions following the conventions for file naming and the folder structure, be sure to fill the needed `READMEs` as well as `UTILS/sim-parameters-all.json`
* open a Pull Request on Github to let the others review your changes

Other things to keep in mind:
* check the Github issues
